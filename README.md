2. Copy files from `dist/` and add to your server library

### Running

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Summary

My overall approach taken for this assingnment was to create an easy to read scalable solution that myself or other devs can easily build upon.

### Functionality Added:

- App Routing and Navigation
- Address Book loaded from API
- API Data Transformation
- API Event System

Given more time I would have liked to add some general styling across the site to make it look less HTMLish. I would probably just use Angular Material to complete it in about an hour or so.

To make this project more robust I suggest creating more unit tests and achieving a better code coverage.
